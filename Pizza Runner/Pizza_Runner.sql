/* 
1. How many pizzas were ordered?
2. How many unique customer orders were made?
3. How many successful orders were delivered by each runner?
4. How many of each type of pizza was delivered?
5. How many Vegetarian and Meatlovers were ordered by each customer?
6. What was the maximum number of pizzas delivered in a single order?
7. For each customer, how many delivered pizzas had at least 1 change and how many had no changes?
8. How many pizzas were delivered that had both exclusions and extras?
9. What was the total volume of pizzas ordered for each hour of the day?
10. What was the volume of orders for each day of the week?

--Data Cleaning and Transformation
--A. Runner_orders Table: To clean the runner_orders table,I created a temporary table otherwise known as a temp_table to acheive this

CREATE TEMP TABLE runner_order_temp AS
   SELECT 
  order_id, 
  runner_id,
  CASE 
    WHEN pickup_time = 'null' THEN NULL
    ELSE pickup_time
  END AS pickup_time,
  CASE 
    WHEN distance = 'null' THEN NULL
    ELSE CAST(TRIM('km' FROM distance) AS NUMERIC)
  END AS distance,
  CASE 
    WHEN duration = 'null' THEN NULL
    ELSE CAST(
      CASE 
        WHEN duration LIKE '%mins' THEN TRIM('mins' FROM duration)
        WHEN duration LIKE '%minutes' THEN TRIM('minutes' FROM duration)
      	WHEN duration LIKE '%minute' THEN TRIM('minute' FROM duration)
        ELSE duration
      END AS NUMERIC
    )
  END AS duration,
  CASE 
    WHEN cancellation = 'null' THEN NULL
    WHEN cancellation = '' THEN NULL
    ELSE cancellation
  END AS cancellation
FROM pizza_runner.runner_orders;

-- B. Customer_orders Table: I created a temp_table for the customer_orders Table also

CREATE TEMP TABLE customer_order_temp AS
SELECT 
  order_id, 
  customer_id, 
  pizza_id, 
  CASE
	  WHEN exclusions = 'null' THEN NULL
	  WHEN exclusions = '' THEN NULL
	  ELSE exclusions
	  END AS exclusions,
  CASE
	  WHEN extras = 'null'  THEN NULL
	  WHEN extras = '' THEN NULL
	  ELSE extras
	  END AS extras,
	order_time
FROM pizza_runner.customer_orders;

-- 1. 

  SELECT count(pizza_id) AS total_ordered_pizzas
  FROM customer_order_temp;

-- 2.

SELECT count( distinct order_id) AS total_unique_orders
FROM customer_order_temp;

-- 3.
  
SELECT count(*) AS sucessful_orders
from runner_order_temp
WHERE cancellation IS NULL


-- 4. 
SELECT pizza_id, COUNT (*) AS no_of_pizzas
from(
	SELECT c.pizza_id,o.cancellation
	FROM customer_order_temp AS c
	LEFT JOIN runner_order_temp AS o USING (order_id)
	)AS order_subquery
WHERE cancellation IS NULL
GROUP BY pizza_id

-- 5. 
SELECT distinct customer_id,
COALESCE(SUM(CASE WHEN pizza_id = 1 THEN 1 END),0) AS "Meat Lovers",	
COALESCE(SUM(CASE WHEN pizza_id = 2 THEN 1 END),0) AS "Vegetarian" 
FROM customer_order_temp
GROUP BY customer_id
ORDER BY 1

-- 6.

SELECT count(pizza_id)AS order_count
FROM customer_order_temp
RIGHT JOIN runner_order_temp AS r USING (order_id)
WHERE cancellation IS NULL
GROUP BY order_id
ORDER BY 1 desc
LIMIT 1

-- 7. 
SELECT c.customer_id,
SUM(CASE WHEN exclusions IS NULL OR EXTRAS IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)AS  No_changes,
SUM(CASE WHEN exclusions IS NOT NULL OR extras IS NOT NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)AS At_least_1_change
FROM customer_order_temp AS c
LEFT JOIN runner_order_temp AS r USING(order_id)
WHERE r.cancellation IS NULL  
GROUP BY c.customer_id

-- 8.
SELECT
SUM(CASE WHEN exclusions IS NOT NULL AND extras IS NOT NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)AS Pizzas_with_Exclusions_and_Extras
FROM customer_order_temp AS c
LEFT JOIN runner_order_temp AS r USING(order_id)
WHERE r.cancellation IS NULL 

-- 9.
