# The World Bank's international debt data
With my increasing understanding of global economics, I have come to understand that countries sometimes take on debt to manage their economy and improve their citizens' quality of life. [The World Bank](https://www.worldbank.org/en/home) is an organization that provides this kind of debt to developing countries.

In this analysis, I will be examining international debt data collected by The World Bank to answer questions such as:

- What is the total amount of debt owed by the countries in the dataset?
- Which country has the highest amount of debt and how much is it?
- What is the average debt owed by countries across different debt indicators?
